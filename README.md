# HTML-CSS
Second project,this time combining HTML and CSS together

I am now putting it all together,combining the skills i have learnt in both HTML and CSS.
I hope to be able to use all that i have learnt more especially with styling and create an eye catching website
The images i used are not my own,they are just random images i found on a free image website(pexels.com)
